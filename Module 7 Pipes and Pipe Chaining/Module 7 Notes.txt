Module 7: Pipes and Pipe Chaining

Pipe sends data from source to destination.

In our example for module 7, we copy data given by the readStream
and give it to the writeStream with help of pipe.

The pipe takes data from the readStream and pumps it to the
writeStream.

All of the contents of example1 file would be copied to example2 file
by connecting the read <-> write streams with pipe
