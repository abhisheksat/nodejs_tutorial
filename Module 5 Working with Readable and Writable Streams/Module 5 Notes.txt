Module 5 : Working with Readable and Writable Streams

Deals with reading and writing data in stream / chunck
as opposed to accessing the file as a whole.

Benfits, you can start processing on the chunk of data
that is available.
You need not wait for the whole file to be loaded and then
perform operations on it.
You can start transmitting / sending / writing to a disk or file
the available chunk of data.
