Module 12: Semantic versioning
"lodash": "^4.17.11" // major version. minor version. patch update 

If we use ^ 'caret' symbol, it means that, node can update the lodash minor version and patch update
The major version would remain the same

We can also use ~'tilde' symbol. It would only fetch patch updates
The major and minor versions would remain the same

We can have no symbols and just the version number. In this case, the version
being used will be unchanged and unaffected by any kind of updates.
