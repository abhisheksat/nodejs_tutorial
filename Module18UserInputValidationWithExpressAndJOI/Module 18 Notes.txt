Module 18: User Input Validation With Express and JOI

We validate the user input on the server side,
as the input data cannot be trusted for security reasons.

npm install joi

We use the joi module to create a schema, that contains the Validation
criteria for the request parameters / properties for which we want to impose
the Validation.

The validate method takes in three arguments
1. The request body to be validated
2. The schema designed, and to be applied for the request body
3. A callback function with two parameters, (error, result)
