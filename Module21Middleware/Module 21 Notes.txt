Module 21: Middleware

The Middleware is the code that get executed between the user request
and the server.

The Middleware can be generic, without any URL pattern
Such a middleware will be executed for every incoming request

If a Middleware is declared and defined for a specific URL pattern,
then only requests for that pattern would first be processed by the
middleware with specific URL then the next function would pass it to
the handler

The middleware can modify the request and response objects.
