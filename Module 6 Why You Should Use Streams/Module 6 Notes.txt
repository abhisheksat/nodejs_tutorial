Module 6 : Why You Should Use Streams

In scenarios where the file size is GBs, it is difficult for the machine
to cache it in main memory.

When accessed using stream, the stream uses a small buffer
which allows us to read the file in chunks.
The file is not read at once, but whenever a data event occurs
a chunk of the file is retrieved.

Thus Stream is memory efficient and allows to read and write
in chunks
